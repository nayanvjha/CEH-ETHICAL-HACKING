Elements of Information Security

1)CIA triad

a) Confidentiality - where sending a message from person A to person B and we dont want anybody to intercept it, and the technology for that will be Aes
b) Integrity - it is the idea that the mssg sent from A to B has not changed, and if u want to guarantee that and the tech that will be used for that will be hashing, or digital signature something like shaw 256
c) Availabilty - whatever resource you have no matter what will always stay online, so if one goes down , a portion of it goes down, a portion of it goes down , u dont lose the whole thing so what might be the tech

d) Authenticity - entity needs to access a resource and we know who that is and verify that entity is who they say they are 


 Attacks = Motive(Goal) * Method(TTP) * Vulnerability

TTPs -> Tactics , Techniques and Procedures

Tactic is the way or strategey adopted by the attacker
Technique is the method that they use
procedure is the system how they do it

vulnerability is  the hole in the system through which attack happens
